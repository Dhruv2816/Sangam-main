				We are Team Sangam, united by a single mission: to drive meaningful change at IIT Jammu. Our vision is to take what is ordinary and transform it into something extraordinary, leaving a lasting impact on the IIT Jammu community. Recognizing the need for an official magazine—something many of us cherished back in school—Kanishka took the bold step to gather a team of passionate individuals. From that moment in our first year, we began on a journey that none of us imagined would take us this far.

With the support and invaluable guidance of Dr. Amitash Ojha, who has been our mentor and problem-solver at every step, Team Sangam has grown not just in size, but in spirit and enthusiasm. We are proud of how far we've come and are more excited than ever about the positive changes and creative expressions we continue to bring to life.

At the end of each semester, we are thrilled to deliver a hardcopy of Sangam to every student. Through these pages, we capture the essence of the events, activities, and moments that shaped the past semester, offering a glimpse into the memories that were made and shared. Sangam is not just a magazine; it’s a reflection of our collective experience as students of IIT Jammu.

Driven by students and created for students, Sangam strives to represent every official event and activity that takes place on campus, giving a voice to the community we are so proud to be a part of. We also felt it was essential to include stories about Jammu itself—whether it’s delving into the history, traditions, or the rich culture of this city we now call home. We believe that every IIT Jammu student should have a deeper connection with the past and present of Jammu, and this is our small but meaningful contribution to fostering that bond.

Thank you for being a part of our journey. Together, we’re building something bigger than ourselves—a tradition that will grow stronger with every passing semester.</p>
